* Week 2 Mar 2017
** Acheived things (Preparing Work environment)
  - Install a virtual machine (linux distribution) thanks to VirtualBox. 
  - Couldn't resize virtual machine display correctly. 
  - Install Simgrid
  - Install emacs and Org mode (for more details see [[http://orgmode.org/]]). 
** Remained issues 
  - Coudln't resize virtual machine display correctly.
  - PC issues : Sometimes I couldn't log in.
** Current work (Become a friend with Simgrid and its features)
  - Read SimGrid references.
       - [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.php]]
       - [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/documentation.php]]
  - Learn how to use Simgrid.
  - Use MSG.
* Week 3 & 4 Mar 2017
** Current work 
  - Change msg OOP C to C++ OOP.
  - Construct UML Diagram for OOP C : to do so, I installed Eclipse Luna version and it modeling tools (see [[https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/neon/1a/eclipse-java-neon-1a-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz]] and [[https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/neon3]]).
** Remarks 
  - Dead link [[https://gitlab.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/doc/examples/platforms]]. (Fixed)
* Week 1-3 Apr 2017
** What's done
  - Construct a first heiarchical class tree on C++ OOP.
** Remained of issues (Current activity)
  - Some cases of test didn't work. (fixed)
** Dev sheet (self-remainder) 
    There are some tools/techniques that i have used lately in particular 
  - ((nice make -j 4 || make ) && nice ctest -j 4 --output-on-failure ; date) 2>&1 | tee BuilSimGrid.sh.log
    nice command to run a program with modified scheduling priority.

* Week 4 Apr 2017
** What's done 
  - fix all issues that were unable to run correctly.
** Current work 
  - Search how to build a suitable forum to simgrid website: for that, the first idea is about searching for several free open source that can fill our needs (as Kunena). 
* Week 1 May 2017
** Current work
  - Install lamp to work on localhost environment : for that it's useful for the first user to follow the instructions that are given on the following website : [[https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/lamp/lamp-on-debian-8-jessie]].     
  - We will attempt to use Mybb a free open source that give the possibility to have a forum interface on static website ( for more info : [[https://mybb.com/]]).
** Remained of issues
  - After getting mybb as a worthy open-source forum to test, my supervisor told me that we didn't have the right to install mysql on the servers, wich unable us to use mybb. 
* Week 2 May 2017
** Current work 
  - I'm tring to fix the problem of tesh-smpi-replay-ti-tracing.
  - Work on SD_exit issue (see the remark).
  - Attend Martin's meetings this week :
  + SimgridVerif project with Marie and Samuel.
  + PhD matrin's student. 
  + Betsegow internship subject : Betsegow and Martin have developed an energy model and they use use it on simgrid and ns-3 software that is developed also by 
    the co-supervisor of Betsegow with theirs students.
  - Attend to Martin's meeting with his PhD student (friday afternoon)   
** Remainder 
    To have a good use of git and understand how workflow git works see the following link [[https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-a-good-git-workflow/]]
    and there is another belongs to gitlab that i found more useful [[https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/]]
** Remarks
  - I tried to resolve the issue that is posted on github (see the link [[https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid/issues/3]]), so I changed SD_exit to be like MSG_exit and I seems that 
    all work well.
  - I took two days of holiday (wednesday and Thursday) to present HPC work. 
** Notes : 
  + lto : for optimization and inlinization of function.
  + lua : allowed to do programming stuf on xml code
  + maintainer_mode : to analizing xml files.
* week 3 May 2017
  + Attend meetings with Martin and having an overview about Betsegow internship and what he did.
  + Read Matrin PhD student's paper about checking models (see doc file).
  + Firday meeting all the day with martin and his PhD student. (where this last has suggested incomplete idea to deal with conflects).
* week 4 May 2017
   Holiday.
* Week 1 Jun 2017
** Current work : 
  - Try to fix memory leak due to trace model (Done)
  - Use signal 'callsback' on sg_ functions.
* Week 2 Jun 2017
** Current Work : 
  - Use a Netpoint signal for sg_instr_new_router function. (Done)
  - Correct the leak of memory that correspond to StartLinkEvent. (Done)
  - Correct the leak of memory that correspond to EndLinkEvent. (Done)
  - Define oncreation and onSeal modules for netZone structure. (Done)
  - applied a signal for sg_instr_new_router. (almost done - tests didn't work)
** Meetings :
  - Tuesday afternoon 1H30 : Meeting with samuel, Marie, and Martin about simgridverif.
  notes :
 Marie wrote a memory overflow probability based on textual syntax of Hasl. In order to evaluate how implement it in the system that we want to create.
  From a first look, the syntax appears a little bit complicated to pose nicely. And as an effect, the code that Samuel has given during the meeting present 
  an interesting attempt to do the job in the python language. Furthermore, to get an output of a little DSL, and avoid parsing problem in the same occasion. 
  - Include netzone reference to sg_instr_AS_begin.  
* Week 3 Jun 2017
** Current work : 
  - observator_(partron_de_conception)
  - static simgrid::xbt::signal<void(NetZone&)>onCreation; #NetZone.hpp
  - see ref. Configure SimGrid in particular (context factory).
  - Read some ref about Pajé and pajéng. 
*** Clean useless class of events.
    The cleaning was done by steps. First of all, we looked for the events that verify the below critera : 
  + the constructor of an event is used in one place
  + if it use print and delete.
    The selected events were cleaned and theirs constructors are turned to a functions. 
*** Notes about visualization 101 :  
  - 13p : how to use API.

  In this stage we looking for clean some useless event, in the following we mention the main criterea to do it : 
  - Read  
* Further objectives
  - Add the missing java-examples to MSG directory.
  - Complete S4U interface.
  - Write a manual for S4U.
